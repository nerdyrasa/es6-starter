### ES6 Starter Project

A starter project that uses ES6 module loader with traceur as the transpiler.

When using ES6 modules:

1. It is not necessary to create IIFEs because anything in the module is scoped to the module and not put on the global window object.
2. The module is automatically put in strict mode.

#### Usage

1. Download files.
2. Run ```npm install``` to install the packages.
3. Run ```npm run dev``` to start the server.
4. Start developing.
